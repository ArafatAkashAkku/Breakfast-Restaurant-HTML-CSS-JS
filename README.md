A burger house or burger restaurant is a dining establishment that specializes in serving hamburgers, a popular type of fast food. These restaurants typically offer a variety of burger options, from classic cheeseburgers to gourmet creations with unique toppings and sauces. Burger houses often have a diverse menu to cater to various tastes. They may offer different types of burgers, such as beef, chicken, turkey, or veggie burgers. Additionally, they might have a selection of buns, cheeses, and toppings to choose from.
